I mentioned earlier that I wrote one of the last books published by the now-bankrupt Wrox Press. A sharp-eyed coworker who happened to be in China the other day sent me a copy of this:

Holy cow, I had no idea that Wrox translated my book into Chinese\! No one ever told me that such a thing was even in the works. Just when I thought that the Wrox saga couldn't get more bizarre, this turns up. Thanks Zhanbo\! I'll treasure it always.
