<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">A number of people have expressed surprise to me that Wrox is out of business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here's the scoop.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">Wrox was owned by a company called Peer, which also owned Friends Of Ed, Glasshaus, and a number of other small businesses in the "developer education" field.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span> </span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">Peer made a big mistake:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>they failed to time the end of the dot com bubble economy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They ended up with massive overproduction of educational materials for developers that suddenly were not saleable. Returns from bookstores were large, and they ended up in big financial trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They managed to keep the company afloat for a few more months, but were eventually unable to get new loans to service the interest on their old loans, which is by definition bankruptcy.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">All of this happened very suddenly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was actually in the process of writing content for their web site and tech reviewing books up to the day before they announced their insolvency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As it turned out, I was pretty lucky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At least my book was published and I was actually paid my advance, though I never received any additional royalties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All in all, Wrox only owed me a few thousand dollars when they went under.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There were plenty of people who had spent months writing books that were ready for the presses -- those people never saw a dime for their work.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">Wrox had two main creditors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They owed the bank of Scotland wodges of cash, and also had a large loan to AOL-Time-Warner-Netscape against all existing stocks of their books as collateral.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Under British law (similar to American law), all creditors get their collateral when the default happens, and everyone else (employees owed wages, authors owed royalties, etc) gets in a line as the remaining assets are auctioned off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unsecured creditors like yours truly go to the end of the creditor line, and shareholders get in line after them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span> </span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">Of course, since Peer had *millions* of pounds in debt and no assets save the existing stocks, all of which went to AOL-Time-Warner-Netscape, I didn't even bother getting in on the action, as there was no action to get in on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span> </span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">Since AOL-Time-Warner-Netscape owned the book stocks, one might wonder what happened to the royalties when they sold them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well, news flash: royalties are **a share of profits**, and no one made a dime of profit on the sale of those books.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They were certainly all sold at a loss.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">Wiley bought the rights to the dozen or so best sellers and the Wrox web site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>APress bought the rights to everything else, and may bring out APress editions of former Wrox books.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">So if you want to buy a copy of my book, you are probably out of luck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I may ask Gary at APress if I can just reformat it into HTML and put it up on the web, if they don't want to bring out an APress edition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After all, I didn't write the thing to make money.</span>
