<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #333399; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">     Make a blogentry about how you started at MS and so on\!</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">You asked, but I'm warning you: it's the most boring story ever.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">I grew up in Waterloo , Ontario , which was a piece of luck as Waterloo has [the best computer science school in Canada](http://www.uwaterloo.ca) . I studied applied mathematics and computer science (along with my close personal friends and fellow bloggers [Dr. Orbifold](http://www.livejournal.com/users/orbifold/) and [Dr. Thingo](http://www.thingo.net)) from 1991 to 1996.  Amongst its many claims to fame, UW has the largest cooperative education program on the planet. For my fourth, fifth and sixth work terms I was an intern on the VBA team here at Microsoft.  On the strength of my internship the VBA team extended me a job offer, which I accepted.  I worked full-time on the scripting technology for five years.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">Then the VBA, Scripting and Microsoft Office Developer teams were reorganized into one large team (the "Trinity" team) tasked with modernizing and improving the Office developer story. I've been working on that for about two years now.  We've just shipped "**Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Tools For The Microsoft Office System 2003**", which I actually did very little work on -- that was Peter Torr 's baby, so read his blog if you want details.  I've been working on the next version, which, of course, I can't talk about except to say that I hope the name is shorter.  Also, I do a fair amount of work still on scripting -- not implementing new features of course, but ongoing work like attending security reviews, helping out our product support and sustaining engineering teams, and (obviously) writing a blog.</span>
