<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">I was intrigued by Neil Deakin's recent [post](http://www.xulplanet.com/ndeakin/article/226?show=c#comments) where he says that when he was a young user, he got mad about all kinds of things that, after a few years as an implementor, he didn't feel mad about anymore.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">I'm with ya, Neil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many of my computer geek high school friends were rather surprised to learn that I had taken a job at Microsoft, given my earlier criticisms of all x86 based software.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(I was an Amiga partisan as a teenager.) I feel the same way you do -- I was a naïve teenager.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">Neil, however, doesn't actually explain why it is that he finds his former beliefs to be naïve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I can't speak for Neil, but I can take a stab at explaining what the revelation was for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Basically it comes down to realizing two things:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(1) good design is a series of **difficult compromises**, and (2) software is by its nature incredibly **complex**.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I failed to appreciate either of those facts until I'd actually done a lot of it myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once I appreciated these things, I understood that we have imperfect software BECAUSE the people who make it are dedicated to writing quality software for end users, not in spite of that fact.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">And it doesn't matter what your business model is -- open source or closed source, give away the software and sell consulting, shrink-wrapped boxes, micropayments, freeware, whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The money story is irrelevant; all software development is about coming up with an **implementable**, **usable** design for a given **group of end users** and then finding **enough resources to implement that design**.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are only a finite number of programmers in the world, and way more problems that need solving than there are resources available to solve them all, so deciding which problems to solve for what users is crucial.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">Sometimes -- not always, but sometimes -- not fixing a trivial, obscure bug with an easy workaround *is* the right thing to if it means that you can spend that time working on a feature that benefits millions of customers. Sometimes features that are useless to you are life-savers for someone else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sometimes -- not always, but sometimes -- using up a few more pennies of hard disk space (ten megs costs, what, a penny these days?) is justifiable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sometimes -- not always, but sometimes -- proprietary designs allow for a more efficient design process and hence more resources available for a quality implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>These are all arguable, and maybe sometimes we humans don't make the \_best\_ choices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But what is naive is to think that these are not hard problems that people think about hard.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">When I was a teenager, I thought software engineering was trivial -- but my end user was myself, and my needs were simple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Software development doesn't scale linearly\!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Complex software that exists to solve the real-world problems of millions of end-users is so many orders of magnitude harder to write, that intuitions about the former can be deeply misleading.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">And this is true in ALL design endevours that involve tough choices and complex implementations\!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was watching the production team commentary track for the extendamix of The Two Towers this weekend, and something that the producers said over and over again was that they got a lot of flack for even slightly changing the story from the book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But before you criticize that choice, you have to **really think through all the implications** of being slaves to the source material.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How would the movie be damaged by showing Merry and Pippin's story **entirely in flashback**?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By *not* interlacing the Frodo-and-Sam story with the Merry-and-Pippen story?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By making Faramir's choice easy? By adding Erkenbrand as the leader of the Westfold?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yes, these are all departures from the book, but they also prevent the movie from being confusing and weak at the end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>None are obvious -- they're all arguable points, and ultimately someone had to make a tough decision to produce a movie that wasn't going to satisfy everyone fully, but would nevertheless actually ship to customers\!</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">There is no perfect software; the world is far too complex and the design constraints are too great for there to be anything even approaching perfect software.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore, if you want to ship the best possible software for your users, you've got to carefully choose your imperfections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the guy who writes tools for you software engineers, my mission is to make tools that afford **deeper abstrations** and hence require **fewer developer resources** to implement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That's the only way we're going to get past the fundamental problems of complexity and expense.</span>
