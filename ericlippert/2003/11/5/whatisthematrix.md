I'm going to make a rare departure from technical stuff for a moment.  I've seen Matrix Revolutions twice in the last twelve hours, once in IMAX.   

 

 

A number of people have asked me for an opinion.  To sum up in a spoiler-free manner:

 

 

First off, IMAX was better, though not enormously so.  (Oddly enough, Reloaded was enormously better in IMAX.)  As an example of state-of-the-art action movie making, it kicked ass.  But what about the underlying theme?  Let's summarize:

 

 

The Matrix was a movie about kung fu vs. evil robots that asked and answered the philosophical question "**what is the nature of reality**?"

 

 

The Matrix Reloaded was a movie about kung fu vs. evil robots that asked and answered the philosophical question "**what is the nature of free will**?"

 

 

Matrix Revolutions was a movie about kung fu vs. evil robots that asked and answered the philosophical question "**if Neo got into a fight with Agent Smith, who would win**?"

 

We return you now to your regularly scheduled programming.
