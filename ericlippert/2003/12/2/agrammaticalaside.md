# A Grammatical Aside

I just wrote in a comment to my previous entry, "The ability to rate one's knowledge of a subject accurately is strongly correlated with one's knowledge."

 

 

Wait a minute.  "One's"???  Word's grammar checker didn't blink at that.  But nor does it blink at "ones".  Well, according to the OED, "one's" **is** the genitive declension of "one".  Let's sum up:

 

 

Pronoun   Genitive

\-----------------

Me        My

You       Your

Us        Our

Him       His

Her       Hers

Them      Their

Thou      Thine

It        Its

One       One's

 

 

I always thought that the reason that "its" doesn't take an apostrophe-s was because the rule "add an apostrophe-s to form a possessive" **applied only to noun phrases**, not to pronouns (And of course, we all know that apostrophe-s does not itself form a genitive **noun** -- otherwise, in the sentence "The First Lady is the President of America's wife," Laura Bush would be associated with America, not President Bush.)

 

 

What the heck is going on here?  Surely there is some grammar pedant out there who can justify this.  My faith in English grammar has been sorely tried.
