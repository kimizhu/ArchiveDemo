# Heads up: Fabulous Adventures will be moving

A number of people have pointed out to me over the last few months that this blog server is a little flaky.  There are occasionally "out of memory" errors and other failures reported, sometimes my posts fail to actually propagate to the server properly, and so on.   

 

 

FYI, some time over the next month I'll be moving my blog over to <http://weblogs.asp.net/> -- that site has the appropriate human and technical resources to handle the considerable (and unexpected\!) response that have been overwhelming the blogs.gotdotnet beta site.

 

 

I apologize in advance for the inconvenience.  I'll see what I can do about moving existing entries over, putting in the appropriate redirects, etc.
