I was describing some of the semantics of reference types earlier, and that reminded me of one of the first questions I was ever asked about reference semantics.

 

 

**Pop quiz:** Are JScript strings passed **by reference** (like JScript objects) or **by value** (like JScript numbers)?

 

 

I'll post the answer tomorrow.
