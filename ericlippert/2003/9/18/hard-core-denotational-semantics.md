<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;">Some of the readers of the Lambda blog ([http://lambda.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$8778?mode=topic\&y=2003\&m=9\&d=18](http://lambda.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader%248778?mode=topic&y=2003&m=9&d=18) </span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;">) were discussing my earlier throwaway line about Waldemar Horwat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span> </span>

*<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-STYLE: italic">The august Waldemar Horwat -- who was at one time the lead Javascript developer at AOL-Time-Warner-Netscape -- once told me that he considered Javascript to be just another syntax for Common Lisp. I'm pretty sure he was being serious.</span>*<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;"> </span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Mozilla's CVS tree still contains the original implementation of Javascript... written in Common Lisp.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;">Now, I can't look at the mozilla sources for legal reasons, so I can't say for sure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, if you look at the drafts of the ECMAScript 4 specification that Waldemar was writing when he worked at Netscape, you'll see that he uses this denotational semantics metalanguage to describe the operation of the ECMAScript language.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(This stands in marked contrast to the vague operational semantics used for the same purpose in the ECMAScript 1, 2 and 3 specifications.)</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;">I vaguely recall that Waldemar had built a reference implementation of ECMAScript 4 in his metalanguage, and an implementation of the metalanguage in Common Lisp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(Like I said, that guy is hard core.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I hypothesize that this is the thing that the Lambda reader was talking about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If someone could confirm or deny my hypothesis for me, I'd be interested to know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is unfortunate that I'm unable to look at this stuff, as I'm sure it would be fascinating.</span>
