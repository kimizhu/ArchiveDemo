<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">The other day I mentioned my worst customer-impacting mistake ever -- marking a heavily used object with the wrong threading model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A number of people commented to me that it was unusual to see a developer own up to such a mistake in a public forum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(Surprisingly, no one pointed out that it was also odd to do so while talking like a pirate.)</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">Well, it's because of restaurants, believe it or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My father has been in the restaurant business for many years. Something he taught me at an early age is that one measure of the quality of a restaurant is **how few mistakes they make**, but a more important measure is **how they treat the customer once a mistake has been made**. Do they **apologize, take responsibility, and immediately act to correct the mistake**, or do they engage in **cover-ups, blame-shifting and foot-dragging**?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I don't go back to the second kind of restaurant, no matter how good the food is.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">The software industry is no different. Here are four aspects to consider:</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">1) Customer focus: Most importantly, when a customer-impacting mistake is made it is necessary to inform customers of the problem, take responsibility and if possible fix the problem, period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If that means they think I'm a bozo, I'm cool with that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Preventing customer pain is a whole lot more important than anyone's opinion of me.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">2) Public image: Just because I don't walk up to you and say "Hi, I'm Eric and I'll be developing your application infrastructure and development tools this evening" doesn't mean that said tools aren't developed by humans with names and faces\!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Too often companies such as Microsoft are perceived as faceless monoliths, a few dozen six-story sea-foam-green glass boxes that mysteriously transform money into code.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This misperception belies the reality; I work with dedicated and talented people who care deeply about making their customers more productive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All those people -- all the testers, developers, managers, writers, etc, -- deserve credit for shipping great software.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And when someone really screws up, well, adult humans should be capable of the occasional mea culpa.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">3) Evolution of the industry: The engineers who sign off on a bridge are quite literally putting their names on the line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If software engineering is ever going to evolve from a craft to a fully-fledged engineering discipline, we need to start acting like engineers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(And as a Waterloo math major, that's hard for me to say with a straight face, believe me\!) <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>If I'm not comfortable with signing on the line and saying that this code is ready for prime time, then I shouldn't be shipping it.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">4) Diffusion of knowledge:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, the best mistakes to learn from are **other people's mistakes**.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Learning from your own mistakes sucks, not to put too fine a point on it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If I can help other people learn from my mistakes, so much the better for the world as a whole.</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;"> </span>

 

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: purple; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Lucida Sans Unicode&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">Coming soon: Eric's *least* customer-impacting mistake ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But that will have to wait until this evening, because my band has a gig at our Product Unit meeting this afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yes, the Trinity Team has their own rock band\!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We are "**Red Pills Reloaded**", aka "**Rage Against The Blue Pills**".</span>
