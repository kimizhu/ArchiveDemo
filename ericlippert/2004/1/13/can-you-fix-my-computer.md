</span><span><span>2)<span>     </span></span></span><span>Do you know Bill Gates?  
</span><span><span>3)<span>     </span></span></span><span>Can you fix my computer? </span>

<span></span>

<span>For the record, the answers are </span>

<span>(1) not yet, and based on how much that kitchen remodel cost, not likely for some time,  
(2) I've spoken to Bill once, in 1994, as an intern, at a party. I asked him what he thought about Linux, which was less of a big deal back then.<span>  </span>I'll avoid getting slashdotted by not passing along his comments at this time.<span> </span>  
(3) very, very unlikely.<span>  </span>I live with a bunch of people with MCE certs for a reason.<span>  </span>I'm hopeless at anything other than language design.</span>
