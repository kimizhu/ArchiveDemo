<span>Hey, this is my 100th post on *Fabulous Adventures in Coding *since I started in September.<span> </span>Good thing I type fast. </span>

<span></span>

<span>I'm sure that most of you are familiar with the classic "software ship cycle" used by Microsoft and myriad other software companies large and small.<span>  </span>On the script team it went something like this: </span>

<span></span>

<span><span>1)<span>     </span></span></span><span>Some customers make feature requests (where by "customer" I'm including internal customers like the IE, ASP and Visual Studio teams, as well as customers out in the real world.)  
</span><span><span>2)<span>     </span></span></span><span>The devs bang out an implementation of the features they think will best serve those customers.  
</span><span><span>3)<span>     </span></span></span><span>The testers test the heck out of the new features, the doc guys write the docs, the localizers translate the error messages into Japanese, etc.  
<span>4)<span>**   ** </span></span></span><span>What are the program managers doing this whole time?<span>  </span>Well, [Peter Torr](http://weblogs.asp.net/ptorr/) answers huge numbers of questions in newsgroups, etc. **Meanwhile, Andrew Clinick surfs the web for a few months.<span>  </span>Once the code is written, tested, and shipped to customers, he writes up a "spec" describing what it does.<span>  </span>Then he orders the "Script Happens\!" T-Shirts for the team.  
**</span><span><span>5)<span>     </span></span></span><span>Six months have passed, so return to step 1.<span>  </span>Remember, this was when people didn't guffaw at the expression "internet time". </span>

<span></span>

<span>And that's how we shipped ten versions of scripting in only 78 months (not counting the QFE releases). At least, that's the way *I* remember it\!<span>  </span>Other people might remember it *slightly* differently.<span>  </span>If you want Andrew's take on it, maybe you should read [his new blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/andrewclinick/).  Welcome to the club, Andrew\!</span>
