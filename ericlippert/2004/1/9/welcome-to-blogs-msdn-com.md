<span>I'm pleased to announce that the good people at MSDN and the good people at ASP.net have worked together to set up a special site for Microsoft bloggers like myself.<span>  </span>[http://blogs.msdn.com](http://blogs.msdn.com/) is a new site hosted by [http://weblogs.asp.net](http://weblogs.asp.net/).<span>  (</span>Either prefix will work for this blog, so don't feel like you've got to go changing your links again.)</span>

<span></span>

<span>I'm still hoping to get the previous blog (<http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/ericli>) redirected here and have the existing content moved over.<span>  </span>More on that as it happens. </span>

<span>\[UPDATE\] As you can see, all the content has been moved over (though some of it has some minor formatting problems on some displays.)  Excellent\! </span>

<span></span>

<span>Many thanks to everyone who made this happen -- I am very glad to not have to deal with the necessary Internet plumbing myself\!</span>
