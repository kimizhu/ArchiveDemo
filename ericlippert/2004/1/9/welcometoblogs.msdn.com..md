I'm pleased to announce that the good people at MSDN and the good people at ASP.net have worked together to set up a special site for Microsoft bloggers like myself.  [http://blogs.msdn.com](http://blogs.msdn.com/) is a new site hosted by [http://weblogs.asp.net](http://weblogs.asp.net/).  (Either prefix will work for this blog, so don't feel like you've got to go changing your links again.)

I'm still hoping to get the previous blog (<http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/ericli>) redirected here and have the existing content moved over.  More on that as it happens. 

\[UPDATE\] As you can see, all the content has been moved over (though some of it has some minor formatting problems on some displays.)  Excellent\! 

Many thanks to everyone who made this happen -- I am very glad to not have to deal with the necessary Internet plumbing myself\!
