I saw Tom Stoppard's play "Jumpers" recently.  The line that got the biggest audience response: "It's not the *voting* that's democracy; it's the *counting*." True, that. I've written a bunch more code for my "Google On The Cheap" series but I've been incredibly heads-down between work, planning a wedding, and my latest book project.  Expect it "real soon now".
