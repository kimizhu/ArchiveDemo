There's a funny thing about tools that I first noticed many years ago: people using tools often know much more about actually using the tools than the people who built the tools\!  Automotive engineers are not usually race car drivers, scalpel manufacturers are usually not surgeons, and so on.

That's certainly the case with the script technologies.  I confess\!  *What I know about the practicalities of scripting the IE object model, or administering a network with WMI, or building a multi-tier ASP site, you could fit into a matchbox. * I know enough to get by in a pinch, but that's *nothing* compared to the real experts.

Got a theoretical question about language design?  I'm you're guy. But if you've got a practical question about scripting, lemme tell ya, *no one* understands practical scripting better than **The Scripting Guys**.  You know that massive book with the faucet puller on the cover, aka “The Windows 2000 Scripting Guide“?  That's them, and they have a new blog.
