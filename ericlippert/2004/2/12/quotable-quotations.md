<span>When I was a teenager, I and a bunch of my more deviant friends would get together every Thursday evening and rent the most godawful horror movies we could find.  We kept a running log of the most unintentionally amusing dialog, such as: </span>

<span></span>

**<span>"I could easily kill you now, but I am determined to HAVE YOUR BRAIN\!"  </span>**

<span></span>

<span>from "*<span>Doctor Butcher: Medical Deviant</span>*", also released under the title "*<span>Zombie Holocaust</span>*".  This movie proves that the Italians made some of the best cannibal zombie movies in the 1980's.</span>

<span>Or</span>

<span> </span>

**<span>"Charge\! Once more into the breach, mothergrabbers\! Let's purloin that water\!"  </span>**

<span>from “*Exterminators From The Year 3000*“, which proves that the Italians made some of the worst post-apocalyptic movies in the 1980's. </span>

<span></span>

<span>I've kept in the habit of writing down ludicrous things people say, and since we have whiteboards along all the hallways here… well, let's just take a representative sampling of the wit and wisdom of the Visual Studio team: </span>

<span></span>

  - <span>"What do you mean *<span>'we'll have to cut the feature'</span>*? This feature **isn't even on the schedule yet**\!" </span>

<span></span>

  - <span>"Shouldn't we design this feature *<span>before</span>* we implement it?"  \[brief pause\] "Ha ha ha ha ha\!" </span>

<span></span>

  - <span>"It's not a design *<span>change</span>*, it's a design *<span>evolution</span>*." </span>

<span></span>

  - <span>"I value diversity -- but -- guys are *weird*." </span>

<span></span>

  - <span>"No, I can't tell you what it says in the spec.  But I can tell you how I implemented it." </span>

<span></span>

  - <span>"We're going to </span><span>QueryInterface</span><span> the object for a magical </span><span>IGeoff</span><span> interface that will allow us to do wacky, incredible things.  But I don't understand how it works yet because Geoff hasn't told me." </span>

<span></span>

  - <span>"Amsterdam is a great place to go if you're looking for cheese sandwiches." </span>

<span></span>

<span>And finally, my new personal favourite advice on how to ship high-quality software on time: </span>

<span></span>

  - <span>"Right now, doing the right thing for the product is the right thing to do."</span>

<span>Truer words were never spoken.</span>
