<span>I know I've been talking a lot about the COM script engines -- how hopelessly twentieth-century\! -- for the last few months.  Coworkers who don't work with me directly every day are often surprised to learn that I haven't been on the script team for about two years now.  I've been awfully busy over the last two years, and finally I can start talking about it.  I've been working on the design and implementation of the plumbing underlying **<span>Microsoft Visual Studio Tools For The Microsoft Office System, version 2.0</span>**.  That's rather a long title, so we usually refer to it as VSTO2 around here. </span>

<span></span>

<span>I'm going to be writing articles and comments for our new VSTO2 blog, which is just getting started at [http://weblogs.asp.net/vsto2](http://weblogs.asp.net/vsto2 "http://weblogs.asp.net/vsto2") -- I'll be sure to include links from this feed as well. </span>

<span></span>

<span>Also, if you guys are interested in VSTO2, or just want to hang out, I'll be giving talks on VSTO2 and the security implications of customized documents in the .NET world at VSLive in San Francisco and Toronto.  I'll try to follow up with blog entries for those of you who, tragically, can't make it.  </span>

<span></span>

<span>If you come to the talk, just remember: I am a professional **<span>software developer</span>**, not a professional **<span>public speaker</span>**.  I'll try to avoid mumbling and babbling, but no guarantees.</span>
