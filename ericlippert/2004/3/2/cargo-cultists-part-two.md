<span></span>

<span>Thanks all for your kind words and cogent thoughts on yesterday's post.  I'd like to sum up some of the wisdom in the comments: </span>

<span></span>

<span>My advice for novice programmers was </span>

<span></span>

  - <span>Don't be a cargo cultist -- understand the meaning and purpose of every line of code before you try to change it. </span>
  - <span></span><span>Understand abstraction, and use it appropriately. </span>

<span></span>

<span>To that, you guys add: </span>

<span></span>

  - <span>learn to use a debugger to step through the code and find problems</span>
  - <span></span><span>learn to NOT use a debugger -- learn to build programs that are debuggable by reading and understanding them</span>
  - <span></span><span>reading code is harder than writing it -- read lots of code</span>
  - <span></span><span>sound methodology is important -- you need to *<span>know</span>* that you got it right</span>
  - <span></span><span>object models carry semantics too -- learn their semantics</span>
  - <span></span><span>realize that mastery of any skill doesn't take ten days, it takes ten years</span>

<span></span>

<span>Good advice\!  </span>

<span></span>

<span>I'd also like to respond to some of the points raised in the comments.  I'll do that over the next couple of days.</span>
