I'm off to [VSLive\! in San Francisco](http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2004/sf/net-architecture.asp), where I'll be giving a talk on Wednesday introducing VSTO2 and a talk on Thursday about security issues involving Office documents and managed code. I'll also be manning the Visual Studio portion of the Microsoft booth Thursday evening and Friday lunch.

If you're at VSLive\! and you want to stop by and say hi, well, now you can.

However, that means that I'm probably not going to get a chance to update the blog until next week.Â  Catch you later\!
