<span lang="en-us">Yesterday I was taking a break from manning the Visual Studio booth down here at VSLive, and kind of wandering around saying hi to people. Had a nice chat with [Mike](http://blogs.xtras.net/mikes/), talked to some customers, checked out what the latest crop of productivity tools looks like -- you know how it goes at these events. I wandered past a booth and caught out of the corner of my eye the words "SQL Anywhere".  </span>

<span lang="en-us">"Holy cow," I said to the booth guy, "there's a product I haven't written any code for in a while".</span>

<span lang="en-us"> "How's that?" the Sybase booth guy asked.  </span>

<span lang="en-us">"I wrote the first ODBC driver for the product that was eventually renamed SQL Anywhere. But that was long before Sybase owned it."</span>

<span lang="en-us">"That must have been some time ago."</span>

<span lang="en-us">"That would be, uh, let me think -- 1992."</span>

<span lang="en-us">He really had no response to that.  </span>

<span lang="en-us">Now I feel old.</span>
