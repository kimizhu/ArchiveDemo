<span>I'm tremendously excited to learn that Joel Silver is producing a sequel to "[Dungeons and Dragons](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190374/ "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190374/")".  That movie was one of the cheesiest, chewiest, goofiest and lowest-grossing episodes of *<span>Scripting Goes To The Movies</span>* ever, and that's saying something.  Say what you will about the plot, acting, set design and special effects; they certainly did an excellent job of capturing the inherent ridiculousness of the D\&D gaming system.  I was particularly fond of Richard O'Brien as a thief who builds elaborate traps for no apparent reason. </span>

<span></span>

<span>Rumour has it that the plot of the [new movie](http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/300/300298p1.html?fromint=1 "http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/300/300298p1.html?fromint=1") is about some evil wizard -- big surprise there -- who steals some black magical orb dingus and chaos ensues. (Which, oddly enough, was exactly the plot of the last D\&D game I played, which was some time ago.  Nice to know that the classics never go out of style.)  </span>

<span>I'm breathless with anticipation to see if they can top lines like "*<span>People of Izmer: you are now free\!\!\!"</span>*  </span>

<span></span>

<span>Speaking of bad dialogue, today is part two of my ongoing series on the wit and wisdom of the *<span>[Visual Studio Tools For Office](http://weblogs.asp.net/vsto2 "http://weblogs.asp.net/vsto2")</span>* team.  (Part one is [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/02/12/71936.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/02/12/71936.aspx").) </span>

<span></span>

<span>"I value diversity -- but -- girls are *weird*." </span>

<span></span>

<span>"This feature will take thirty seconds to test."  (Spoken by, you guessed it, a dev.) </span>

<span></span>

<span>"Now *that* is thinking in an *<span>entirely different</span>* box." </span>

<span></span>

<span>"I'm not [<span title="http://weblogs.asp.net/andrewclinick">Andrew Clinick</span>](http://weblogs.asp.net/andrewclinick "http://weblogs.asp.net/andrewclinick"); you can't whip me like you whip him\!" </span>

<span></span>

<span> </span>

<span> </span>

<span> </span>

<span>Devs are smart, but sometimes it takes a moment to deduce all logical consequences of a statement in realtime: </span>

<span>Dev: "I'll schedule you for five o'clock."  
</span><span>PM: "I can't make it then, I have to pick up my kid from day care."  
</span><span>Dev: "I didn't know you had kids\!"  
</span><span>PM: "Yeah, I have a four year old."  
</span><span>Dev: "Really?  Since when?"  
</span><span>PM: "Uh… just over **four years** actually." </span>

<span></span>

<span>And finally, a conversation that sums up the relationship between program management, development and quality assurance: </span>

<span></span>

<span>A PM: "Is there anything I can do for you?"  
</span><span>A Dev: "Go get me a coffee."   
</span><span>A Tester: "Here, let me taste that for you." </span>
