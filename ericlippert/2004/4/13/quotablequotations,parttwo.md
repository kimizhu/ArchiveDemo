# Quotable Quotations, Part Two

I'm tremendously excited to learn that Joel Silver is producing a sequel to "[Dungeons and Dragons](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190374/ "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190374/")".  That movie was one of the cheesiest, chewiest, goofiest and lowest-grossing episodes of *Scripting Goes To The Movies* ever, and that's saying something.  Say what you will about the plot, acting, set design and special effects; they certainly did an excellent job of capturing the inherent ridiculousness of the D\&D gaming system.  I was particularly fond of Richard O'Brien as a thief who builds elaborate traps for no apparent reason. 

Rumour has it that the plot of the [new movie](http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/300/300298p1.html?fromint=1 "http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/300/300298p1.html?fromint=1") is about some evil wizard -- big surprise there -- who steals some black magical orb dingus and chaos ensues. (Which, oddly enough, was exactly the plot of the last D\&D game I played, which was some time ago.  Nice to know that the classics never go out of style.)  

I'm breathless with anticipation to see if they can top lines like "*People of Izmer: you are now free\!\!\!"*  

Speaking of bad dialogue, today is part two of my ongoing series on the wit and wisdom of the *[Visual Studio Tools For Office](http://weblogs.asp.net/vsto2 "http://weblogs.asp.net/vsto2")* team.  (Part one is [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/02/12/71936.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/02/12/71936.aspx").) 

"I value diversity -- but -- girls are *weird*." 

"This feature will take thirty seconds to test."  (Spoken by, you guessed it, a dev.) 

"Now *that* is thinking in an *entirely different* box." 

"I'm not [Andrew Clinick](http://weblogs.asp.net/andrewclinick "http://weblogs.asp.net/andrewclinick"); you can't whip me like you whip him\!" 

 

 

 

Devs are smart, but sometimes it takes a moment to deduce all logical consequences of a statement in realtime: 

Dev: "I'll schedule you for five o'clock."  
PM: "I can't make it then, I have to pick up my kid from day care."  
Dev: "I didn't know you had kids\!"  
PM: "Yeah, I have a four year old."  
Dev: "Really?  Since when?"  
PM: "Uh… just over **four years** actually." 

And finally, a conversation that sums up the relationship between program management, development and quality assurance: 

A PM: "Is there anything I can do for you?"  
A Dev: "Go get me a coffee."   
A Tester: "Here, let me taste that for you."
