# Plumbing the Depths of .NET For Office

[My lead Eric Carter has started blogging about the work we're doing on VSTO2](http://blogs.msdn.com/eric_carter).  I'm excited that he's taken the plunge into blogging about this stuff for two reasons.  

First, no one has a broader or deeper technical understanding of the plumbing underlying the programming model that we're designing for Office than Eric.  (Which explains why the last time he took a vacation we decorated his office with plumbing supplies.)

Second, since he's doing it, that takes the onus of blogging about all this cool stuff off me so that I can continue to blog about hopelessly 20th century technologies.

 

(Speaking of which -- more is coming on SimpleScript soon, I promise.  We're crazy busy getting the bugs out for Whidbey Beta 1, and as we start to get into actual semantics, the code is getting harder to write.)
