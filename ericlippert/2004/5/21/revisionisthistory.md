Based on the excellent user feedback, I have significantly revised my article on the history of the strange VB/VBScript programming practice of habitually clearing objects unnecessarily right before they go out of scope.  The revisions were sufficiently large that it seemed better to revise the original article with the new information rather than posting a followup.  In the interests of journalistic integrity and historical truth, I've preserved the original, less clueful version in my new “Revisionist History“ archive.

The less clueful original version is [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/articles/136883.aspx). The more clueful revision is [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/ericlippert/archive/2004/04/28/122259.aspx).
