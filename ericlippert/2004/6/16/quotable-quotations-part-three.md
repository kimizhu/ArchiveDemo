<span>I'm heads-down today trying to figure out a complicated new feature in Whidbey -- working out the differences between the spec and the code is proving to be quite a challenge\! -- so today, another entry in [my](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/02/12/71936.aspx) [series](http://weblogs.asp.net/ericlippert/archive/2004/04/13/112749.aspx) on **<span>the wit and wisdom of the Visual Studio team</span>**: </span> <span></span> <span class="underline"><span>Movie allusions </span></span>

<span></span> <span>"This is established 'Alien vs. Predator' folklore."</span><span> </span>

<span></span> <span>"I cannot be stopped by mere bullets\!"</span> <span><span>"Neo could kick Yoda's ass\!"</span></span> <span><span>(Please discuss the latter.)</span> </span>

<span></span> <span class="underline"><span>Baby talk </span></span>

<span></span> <span>There have been a spate of reproductive successes on my team recently.  Here's what happens when three developers try to coo over a newborn baby: </span>

<span></span> <span>Developer \#1:</span><span> "Wow, she's like a really tiny human\!"  
</span><span>Developer \#2:</span><span> "That's because she *<span>is</span>* a really tiny human."  
</span><span>Developer \#3, aka “dad“:</span><span> "Yes, she's the human equivalent of a 30% scaled in-place view control."</span> <span>Not pretty.  (The developers, that is -- the baby was cute.) </span>

<span></span> <span class="underline"><span>Why devs really do need PMs around to keep them in line </span></span>

<span></span> <span>Dev \#1:</span><span> "If we pick one of the two interfaces at random, we're going to get it wrong 50% of the time.  Customers aren't going to be happy about that."  
</span><span>Dev \#2:</span><span> "You're a real 'glass half empty' guy, aren't you?  Think of all the millions of times we'll get it right\!" </span>

<span></span> <span>Dev:</span><span> "Checkin suites are just another hurdle on the road to checking in broken code." </span>

<span></span> <span class="underline"><span>More on the Program Management / Development relationship </span></span>

<span></span> <span>PM to Dev:</span><span> "It is so unpleasant being me using this product.  Jack, we have a date with a spreadsheet." </span>

<span></span> <span>A PM on the necessity of cutting features vs. slipping schedules</span><span>: "I have a hacksaw in my office for a reason."  </span>

<span></span> <span>(It's true -- he does have a hacksaw in his office.  Weird.) </span>

<span></span> <span>PM: </span><span>"We need to get this fixed.  I'm going to take this to \[name of Microsoft Distinguished Engineer here\]."  
</span><span>Dev:</span><span> "Yeah\!  Do it\!  Get on his schedule\!  Call in all your favours\!"  
</span><span>PM:</span><span> "I already did.  Do you have time to come to the meeting next week?"  
</span><span>Dev:</span><span> "Whoa -- I don't want to get involved\!" </span>

<span></span> <span>And finally, my personal favourite for this month: </span>

<span></span> <span>PM:</span><span> "It's easy to be smart.  It's being right that's hard."   
</span><span>Dev:</span><span> "No, it's easy to be smart *<span>and</span>* right.  It's convincing PMs that you're right that's hard."</span>
