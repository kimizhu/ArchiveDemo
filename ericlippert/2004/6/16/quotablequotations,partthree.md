I'm heads-down today trying to figure out a complicated new feature in Whidbey -- working out the differences between the spec and the code is proving to be quite a challenge\! -- so today, another entry in [my](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/02/12/71936.aspx) [series](http://weblogs.asp.net/ericlippert/archive/2004/04/13/112749.aspx)on **the wit and wisdom of the Visual Studio team**:   Movie allusions 

 "This is established 'Alien vs. Predator' folklore." 

 "I cannot be stopped by mere bullets\!" "Neo could kick Yoda's ass\!" (Please discuss the latter.) 

 Baby talk 

 There have been a spate of reproductive successes on my team recently.  Here's what happens when three developers try to coo over a newborn baby: 

 Developer \#1: "Wow, she's like a really tiny human\!"  
Developer \#2: "That's because she *is* a really tiny human."  
Developer \#3, aka “dad“: "Yes, she's the human equivalent of a 30% scaled in-place view control." Not pretty.  (The developers, that is -- the baby was cute.) 

 Why devs really do need PMs around to keep them in line 

 Dev \#1: "If we pick one of the two interfaces at random, we're going to get it wrong 50% of the time.  Customers aren't going to be happy about that."  
Dev \#2: "You're a real 'glass half empty' guy, aren't you?  Think of all the millions of times we'll get it right\!" 

 Dev: "Checkin suites are just another hurdle on the road to checking in broken code." 

 More on the Program Management / Development relationship 

 PM to Dev: "It is so unpleasant being me using this product.  Jack, we have a date with a spreadsheet." 

 A PM on the necessity of cutting features vs. slipping schedules: "I have a hacksaw in my office for a reason."  

 (It's true -- he does have a hacksaw in his office.  Weird.) 

 PM: "We need to get this fixed.  I'm going to take this to \[name of Microsoft Distinguished Engineer here\]."  
Dev: "Yeah\!  Do it\!  Get on his schedule\!  Call in all your favours\!"  
PM: "I already did.  Do you have time to come to the meeting next week?"  
Dev: "Whoa -- I don't want to get involved\!" 

 And finally, my personal favourite for this month: 

 PM: "It's easy to be smart.  It's being right that's hard."   
Dev: "No, it's easy to be smart *and* right.  It's convincing PMs that you're right that's hard."
