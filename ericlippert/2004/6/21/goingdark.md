 Hey all, at the end of this week I'm heading off on vacation for two weeks, I've got a metric boatload of work to get finished before I go, and (thankfully) there are no computers where I'm going.Â  Therefore the blog is probably going to go dark until mid July. But by all means, if you've got questions or suggestions for topics, send them to me and I'll have a look when I get back.
