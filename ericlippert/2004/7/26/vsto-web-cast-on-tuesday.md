<span>I've just now learned that my colleagues Andrew Jewsbury and Mohit Gupta will be talking about the recent beta release of our product -- Visual Studio Tools For Office -- July 27th in a web cast.  Mohit and Andrew are responsible for much of the design and implementation of key portions of VSTO, so this should be interesting. </span> <span></span><span>The web cast will take place from 1:00PM to 2:30PM Pacific Daylight Time. </span><span>If you're interested, you can [register for the web cast here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=32757 "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=32757").</span>
