I've just now learned that my colleagues Andrew Jewsbury and Mohit Gupta will be talking about the recent beta release of our product -- Visual Studio Tools For Office -- July 27th in a web cast.  Mohit and Andrew are responsible for much of the design and implementation of key portions of VSTO, so this should be interesting.  The web cast will take place from 1:00PM to 2:30PM Pacific Daylight Time. If you're interested, you can [register for the web cast here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=32757 "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=32757").

UPDATE: Today's webcast the first of a series.  [Information on the six-part series of VSTO web casts can be found here](http://weblogs.asp.net/vsto2/archive/2004/07/27/198561.aspx).
