One of the truly great things about working here is that [Distinguished Engineers take time out of their busy schedules to answer random questions](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottwil/archive/2005/01/14/353177.aspx). Many thanks to Anders and Scott for sharing their insights. Incidentally, [as I've mentioned before](http://weblogs.asp.net/ericlippert/archive/2003/12/01/53412.aspx), I'll sometimes ask interview candidates how good a C++ programmer they are on a scale from one to ten.  If they say "nine", I'll ask them the kind of question that I asked Scott and see what they say. (And yes, I was for many years known as "that guy who's always wearing the Tilley hat".  I still have many Tilleys at home, but I usually only wear them when I'm sailing now.)
