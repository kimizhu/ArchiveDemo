The last chat we had just after PDC was a virtual mob scene. We had hundreds of questions, way more than we could handle in the short time that everyone was available. Now that you've all had some time to absorb some of the new stuff coming up, we thought that we'd have another opportunity for you to ask questions directly to the design and implementation teams. As always, [Scott Nonnenberg is the man with the plan. See his blog for details](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottno/archive/2005/10/14/481286.aspx).
