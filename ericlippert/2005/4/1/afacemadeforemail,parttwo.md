[One year ago this week](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/04/06/108652.aspx)I was the [Channel Nine](https://channel9.msdn.com/) guinea pig -- I'm still not sure why, but for some reason [The Scobelizer](http://scoble.weblogs.com/) and his cohort chose me to be the first guy interviewed for their project. (Probably because I'm mostly harmless.) Channel Nine has succeeded tremendously, and I'm very pleased to have been a part of it at its birth. Recently Charles and Robert tracked me down and cornered me in a room with a **really big** XBOX screen to talk about Visual Studio Tools For Office and how we use .NET code access security. If you've got 53 minutes to kill and you want to hear me ramble on about what I love to talk about most, [check it out](https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=53466).
