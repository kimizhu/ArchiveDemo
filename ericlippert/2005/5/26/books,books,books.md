It looks like the intricacies of higher-dimensional geometry will have to wait another week; I am incredibly heads-down putting the finishing touches on VSTO and the book that [Eric Carter](http://blogs.msdn.com/eric_carter/) and I are writing on VSTO. We're due to have it ready for copy-editing and indexing by the end of the month, so I know what I'm going to be doing this weekend, and its not barbecuing or sailing. Ah well, plenty of time for that later. Speaking of books, [Joel](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) was kind enough to do me the honour of choosing [How Many Microsoft Employees Does It Take To Change A Light Bulb?](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2003/10/28/53298.aspx) as one of his selections for his new blogs-printed-out-on-dead-trees book [The Best Software Writing](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595009/qid=1117148546/sr=8-3/ref=pd_csp_3/102-5349498-3080915?v=glance&s=books&n=507846). TBSW will also feature articles by [Raymond](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/) and many other smart, funny, controversial and thought-provoking technical bloggers and will be available to purchase on June 20th. It was hard to resist the temptation to read the galleys of everyone else's articles, but somehow I managed -- I'm totally looking forward to seeing what all Joel has chosen.
