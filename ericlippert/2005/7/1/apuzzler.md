# A Puzzler

Some fun for the Friday of a long weekend.  And a true story to boot\! I had a job to do last Tuesday night that required the purchase of a few tools. As I was driving home from the store I took a look at the pile of stuff in the seat beside me and was quite amused – it all made perfect sense to me, but I wondered if anyone glancing into my car would deduce that these were all for the same job:

  - a popsicle stick
  - a small tub of plumbers’ putty
  - a bucket
  - a box of Crayola pastels
  - a bicycle pump
  - a sheet of coarse sandpaper
  - a bottle of organic oil soap
  - one additional item

What was the additional item? What was my chore last night? (I've submitted this to *Car Talk*, so expect it to be on the radio show in five or ten years.) I hope all you readers in the United States and Canada have a good Canada Day and/or Independence Day\!
