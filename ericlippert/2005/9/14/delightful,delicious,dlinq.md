As you've probably already heard, at long last we've announced the [new features](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/future/) that we're planning on delivering in C\# 3.0. Our primary goal for 3.0 is to enable programmers to concisely represent complex query logic on arbitrary collections in C\#. That's great, and as a C\# user who spent the last three years playing around with data access in C\#, I'm excited about that. But as [Cyrus points out](http://blogs.msdn.com/cyrusn/archive/2005/09/13/465390.aspx), what's more exciting to me is how we're going to get there. In order to build the kind of language integrated query system we want, we're going to have to add features to C\# that I've been wanting for years: lambdas, type inference, anonymous types, and so on. These have applications far broader than integrated query. The reason that we tell you guys about the secret goodies long before we're ready to ship is because we want your feedback as early as possible. It costs a considerable number of dollars to implement this stuff and we want to be very sure that we're building the features that really do make your lives as programmers easier. So please, please, write blogs, send me email, leave comments, attend [chats](http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats//l05_0922_MSDN_CL), be vocal. If you're excited by this stuff, let us know. If you think that the goal is good but the proposed implementation is lousy, let us know. We want to hear it\! \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* In unrelated news, I have always wondered how the magic sunglasses in the classic John Carpenter movie [They Live](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/)worked.  Perhaps [this](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/09/privacy_enhance.html)partially explains it?
