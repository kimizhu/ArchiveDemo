Our first post-PDC C\# chat about the recently announced 3.0 features is today, Thursday, at 1 PM Pacific Daylight Time. I'm looking forward to being there. [See Scott's blog for details](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottno/archive/2005/09/21/472540.aspx) about this and all upcoming chats. Also, I'll be hanging around the MVP summit when I have free time. I hope to meet up with some of our C\# and scripting MVPs.
