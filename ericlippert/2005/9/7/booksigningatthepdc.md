It's a week until PDC\! Very exciting. Unfortunately I'm not going this year but my coauthor and erstwhile lead [Eric Carter](http://blogs.msdn.com/eric_carter) will be there, along with [Misha Shneerson](http://blogs.msdn.com/mshneer/archive/2005/09/06/461766.aspx)and [Andrew Whitechapel](http://blogs.msdn.com/andreww/). He'll be talking about VSTO 2.0 (the about-to-be-released product) and you can also see a sneak preview of early VSTO 3.0 work running against Office 12. All [the VSTO session details](http://blogs.msdn.com/eric_carter/archive/2005/09/06/461739.aspx) are on Eric's blog. Eric will also be [signing](http://blogs.msdn.com/eric_carter/archive/2005/09/06/461743.aspx) copies of [our book](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2005/06/06/425847.aspx). We haven't even seen copies yet\! The ink will probably still be wet at the PDC. And of course, Anders will be talking about the new C\# 3.0 features coming up, which is good, because then I'll be able to blog about them while we're working on them. Excitement, adventure, really wild stuff. I'll see if I can get the PDC gig next time. This blogging stuff is nice, but it's even better to be able to meet real customers face-to-face.
