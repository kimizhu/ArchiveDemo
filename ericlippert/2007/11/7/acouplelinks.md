Just two unrelated links today.

First, Raymond's post today reminded me of one of my favourite lines from the [L.A. Story screenplay](http://www.amazon.com/L-Story-Roxanne-Screenplays/dp/0802135129):

*"Look, rather than do an interview with me, which would be fascinating, by the way, because of my* [*interesting word usements I structure*](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/11/07/5948256.aspx)*, what if I showed you around town a little?"*

Pre-envisioning?Â What could this possibly mean?

And second, my colleague on the C\# compiler development team and fellow Waterloo alumnus [Sam Ng has started blogging](http://blogs.msdn.com/samng/). Check it out\!
