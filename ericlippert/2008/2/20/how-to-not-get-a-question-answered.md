Raymond has had lots of great posts over the years on how to not get a question answered. Some of the ways he points out that help ensure that a question goes unanswered are:

  - Use a [difficult](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/23/7203582.aspx) or [meaningless](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/18/1488858.aspx) subject line.
  - [Ask a grammatically unclear question](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/11/08/5973122.aspx).
  - [Forget to actually ask a question](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/12/4872632.aspx) ([this](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/15/1883515.aspx) is a personal favourite of mine; back when I was working on scripting I would practically daily get an email consisting of a stack trace and a crash report, with *no indication whatsoever* of what the sender wanted me to do with it. Investigate it? Commiserate? Give career advice?)
  - [Ask an unanswerable question over and over again](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/13/2106139.aspx).

I would add that [phrasing the question in terms of the attempted solution rather than the underlying problem](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2003/11/03/53333.aspx) is a great way to have a question remain unanswered. But I already did that. Today's rant, rather, is:

A great way to not get your question answered is to **treat the person that you're asking to share their time and knowledge like they're not a human being**.

I understand that this is easy to do.

I understand that when someone is asking a technical question, it is almost always because they're *deeply frustrated* by their inability to make some important specific complicated thing work the way they'd expect.

I understand that software makers are a big source of frustration in a more general sense. We all use imperfect software every day; little frustrations mentally accumulate in a way that little victories do not.

I understand that programming languages and software in general is often *counterintuitive*, and that understanding the complex reasoning behind a counterintuitive result is often seemingly of little practical import compared to just getting the problem at hand solved.

I understand that it is very easy to use an email client as an *impersonal and automatic information resource* something like a search engine, where you just type in your query, you get your result back, and you move on with your day.

I understand that there is an inherent and pervasive bias in pure-text communication which makes statements intended to be *good-humoured* sound *sophomoric*, makes statements which were intended to be *friendly* sound *smarmy*, makes statements which were intended to be *enthusiastic* sound *brash*, makes statements intended to be *helpful* sound *condescending*, makes statements which were intended to be *precise and accurate* sound *brusque and pedantic,* makes statements which were intended to be *positive* sound *neutral*, and makes statements which were intended to be *neutral* seem downright *hostile*.

(Boy, do I ever understand that. For over four years I have deliberately tried to pitch the tone of this blog as good-humoured, friendly, enthusiastic, helpful, precise, accurate and positive; **I suspect that most of the time I fail badly at most or all of those**. Writing is *hard*.)

I understand all that, from both sides; I've certainly been on both the sending and receiving ends of all of the above, many times.

Which is why I try very hard to be helpful to the *complete strangers* who send me *overtly rude* and *frequently profane* emails capped off with a request for me to to take time out of my day to explain something to them.

I try to see an upset or confused user as an opportunity to make a good impression; sometimes people do a complete 180 when you help them out and are appreciative and grateful. Sometimes they even send an unsolicited note to your manager, which is always pleasant.

But more often, I never hear from them again after their question is answered.

None of this is in their own best interests. It makes the human information sources they rely upon less likely to help them now and in the future.

So, just a friendly reminder. (A **friendly, good-humoured, helpful, enthusiastic, positive** reminder\!) The people you are sending email to about your technical problems are *people*. It would be **smart** to briefly introduce yourself, describe your problem without insulting the people who created it, indicate what you've done to attempt to solve it yourself, actually *ask* for help, and later say thank-you for their time whether they manage to actually help you or not.

It's smart because doing so is in your own best interests.

It would also be **nice**, but I actually am not particularly concerned about "nice" today. *Nice* is *nice* to have I suppose. But not being *smart* is just *dumb*.
