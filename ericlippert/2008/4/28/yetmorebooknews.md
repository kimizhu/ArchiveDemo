It's a bookish day apparently. I am pleased to pass on news of the availability of the book [Eric Carter](http://blogs.msdn.com/eric_carter/) and I wrote about VSTO, now in Chinese. Here is Jie Wang holding a copy of the original C\# book and the VSTO开发指南 Visual Basic book:

Many thanks to Jie Wang, Mei Liang, and everyone at Addison Wesley and 中国电子工业出版社 (China Publishing House of Electronics Industry) who helped make this possible.
