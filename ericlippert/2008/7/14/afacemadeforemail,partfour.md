Good heavens, [this](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/tags/Video/default.aspx) just keeps on happening to me.

If you're interested in what we're musing about for future versions of C\#, [check out this video](https://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Charles/C-40-Meet-the-Design-Team/) of Anders Hejlsberg, [Scott Wiltamuth](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottwil/), [Paul Vick](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/), [Mads Torgersen](http://blogs.msdn.com/madst), [Matt Warren](http://blogs.msdn.com/mattwar), [Jim Hugunin](http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/) and, off in one corner, me.

Working with this caliber of people every day is a huge part of what makes this the best job ever.
