Happy new year all -- I hope 2008 was a good year for you and that 2009 will be better. I myself was crazy busy at the end of 2008, working on a number of at-work projects and personal projects which I'm not going to blog about at this time. I hope to get more time in the schedule for blogging in the next couple of months.

I want to start off the year with the belated announcement that we have shipped a printed and bound version of the C\# 3.0 specification. Why would you want the dead-trees version when you can just [get the Word document off the web](http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2007/08/20/c-3-0-specification-now-available.aspx)? Because **the print edition is annotated**.

Yes, we were fortunate enough to get Brad Abrams, Joseph Albahari, Krzysztof Cwalina, Jesse Liberty, Fritz Onion, Vladimir Reshetnikov, Chris Sells, Bill Wagner, plus me, to write annotations for those areas of the specification that we each found interesting.

There are lots of good comments that elucidate tricky bits, give historical context, provide advice and guidance, rail against restrictions, and so on. My only complaints are that the annotations are so brief and that I wish I had had the time to more fully annotate every bit of the spec. But then again, that's a big part of what this blog is for, so I shouldn't complain *too* much.
