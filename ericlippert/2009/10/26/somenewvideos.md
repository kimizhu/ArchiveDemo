Somehow it has happened again; people just keep on recording videos of me and putting them on the internet.

In these videos you find out what I look like when lit from above and behind. Kinda spooky. We should have made the room entirely dark and held a flashlight underneath my face. That would be, like, [ten times scarier](http://xenon.xe.net/inthumor/ih_026.htm). Anyway, if you're interested in me blathering on about my favourite feature in C\# 4, covariance and contravariance of interface and delegate types, here are two little demo videos: [Part One](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/ee672314.aspx), [Part Two](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/ee672319.aspx). (There seems to be some minor sound sync issues here and there, but it's not really a problem; most of theÂ audio is voice-over.)

Charlie has been crazy busy getting these little videos together; here are some more of his recent efforts, including some good ones from my colleagues Chris and Sam talking about all the other far more awesome features of C\# 4.0: dynamic interop, improved interop with Office, named and optional parameters, and so on. Links to all of our recent videos are here: <http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2009/10/19/community-convergence-lvi.aspx>.

Have an amusing and safe Hallowe'en -- I'll be going to Hallowe'en parties on a small island this year, just for a change of pace.
