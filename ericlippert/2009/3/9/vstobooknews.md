[![vsto2007](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/ericlippert/WindowsLiveWriter/VSTOBookNews_72F7/vsto2007_thumb.jpg)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/ericlippert/WindowsLiveWriter/VSTOBookNews_72F7/vsto2007_2.jpg)I am pleased to announce that [my co-author Eric Carter has made significant updates to our VSTO book](http://blogs.msdn.com/eric_carter/archive/2009/03/02/new-vsto-3-0-and-office-2007-book-hot-off-the-presses.aspx). (Though I notice with chagrin that one of the changes is that [the title is much shorter than it ought to be](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2006/05/01/visual-studio-tools-for-office-using-visual-basic-2005-with-excel-work-outlook-and-infopath.aspx).) It is not yet available in bookstores but will be soon.

The new parts of the book (which I did no work on at all, this one is Carter's baby\!) cover the 3.0 version of VSTO in great detail; if you're looking for the definitive work on the subject, this is it.

See [Eric Carter's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/eric_carter/) for more details to come.
