I am pleased to announce that a bunch of our Russian MVPs who (1) are awesome people and (2) apparently have some free time on their hands, have started translating this blog into Russian, of all things.

Thanks to all the Russian MVPs and particularly to developer evangelist Gaidar Magdanurov for organizing and overseeing this effort.
