No technology today. I have not done a post on relationship advice in ages\!

Compare and contrast these two conversations:

\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Version One:**

**Alice**: Thanks for having lunch with me. I suppose you know what I want to talk about.

**Eric**: Yeah, I do. I think you shouldn't jump to conclusions solely on the basis of all the rumours that are going around. There are any number of *perfectly innocent* reasons why Bob and Eve could have been seen together at Chez Franch together last month.

**Alice**: What?\!

**Eric**: Huh?

**Alice**: First she intercepts my email, then she steals my boyfriend?\!? [Passive attacker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob) my eye\!

This conversation, already off to a bad start, is not going to get any better.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Version Two:**

**Alice**: Thanks for having lunch with me. I suppose you know what I want to talk about.

**Eric**: No, I do not.

**Alice**: I was hurt that you didn't invite me to the book signing.

**Eric**: I *did* invite you to the book signing. Check your spam filter.

**Alice**: \[boot laptop, search email...\] Ah. Yes you did invite me. And I see your new book is called "Make Money Fast With Nigerian Viagra"; did *anyone* actually get the invitation?

**Eric**: Hmm, that might explain the low turnout.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Important human relationship safety tip: the correct answer to "*do you know what I am thinking?*" is "*no*". Remember, **there are** **at least two thick slabs of bone between your brain and everyone else's brain**. Those thick slabs of bone impede telepathy.
