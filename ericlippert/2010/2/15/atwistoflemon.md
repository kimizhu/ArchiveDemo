I was browsing the archive of design notes from the early days of the C\# language the other day. Apparently whoever was editing the notes back then had a sense of humour. (UPDATE: [It was Scott, just as I suspected](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/08/12/213778.aspx).) I stumbled across this note from May 1999:

We considered a proposal to rename **short**, **int**, and **long** to **short**, **tall**, and **grande**. More thought on this issue is required; we will revisit this issue on Friday.

And yet the notes for the following Friday say nothing of it. Someone dropped the ball.

Itâ€™s not too late. I propose in the same vein that we rename **float**, **double** and **decimal** to **singleshot**, **doubleshot** and **quadrupleshot**. **byte** can be **cappuccino**. And of course the [BigInteger](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.numerics.biginteger\(VS.100\).aspx) in the new math library can be [half double decaffeinated half-caf with a twist of lemon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CrML0BzOA).
