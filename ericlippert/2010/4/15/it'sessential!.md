My copy of Essential C\# 4.0 just arrived, and it looks great. I was one of the technical reviewers of this book. Some books are a pain to edit, but the Essential C\# series is one of my favourites. It totally lives up to its name; it really does give you lots of essential information for developing high-quality real-world programs in C\#.

I just wanted to take this opportunity to publically congratulate Mark on his latest accomplishment in publishing and to thank him for his kind words in the acknowledgements. I’d also like to thank everyone at A-W for supporting my book editing habit and for supporting the community by publishing great books about C\#. Thank you all.
