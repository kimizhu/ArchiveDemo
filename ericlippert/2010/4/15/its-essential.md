My copy of Essential C\# 4.0 just arrived, and it looks great. I was one of the technical reviewers of this book. Some books are a pain to edit, but the Essential C\# series is one of my favourites. It totally lives up to its name; it really does give you lots of essential information for developing high-quality real-world programs in C\#.

I just wanted to take this opportunity to publically congratulate Mark on his latest accomplishment in publishing and to thank him for his kind words in the acknowledgements. Iâ€™d also like to thank everyone at A-W for supporting my book editing habit and for supporting the community by publishing great books about C\#. Thank you all.
