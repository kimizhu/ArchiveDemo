# More Boring Metablogging

Hey everyone, those of you who read this blog on the main MSDN page rather than via your own RSS reader have probably noticed that the new default themes went live yesterday.

I am aware that the new theme does not make particularly efficient use of precious screen real estate. I am a cargo cult programmer when it comes to CSS; I steal other people's code and hack around until I get something which barely works. I've tightened up the tag cloud and reduced the size of the sidebar; figuring out how to expand the text so that it fills more than just the center of the screen is at present beyond my limited abilities and I have other priorities. I'll figure it out eventually; bear with me.

If you have comments on the default layout or any other aspect of the new blog software, I encourage you to send them to someone who can actually do something about it, i.e., not me. The hard-working and overwhelmed-with-email [Sean Jenkin](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/seanjenkin/) is the person to send feedback to. Thanks to Sean and the whole MSDN / TechNet / Telligent team for all your hard work getting the new system going; I look forward to using it.
