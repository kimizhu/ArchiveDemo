Hey everybody, just a quick FYI, I will be attending [TechEd New Orleans](http://www.microsoft.com/events/techednorthamerica/) this year. I'll be hanging out at Mads' sessions, manning the booth and attending as many parties as I can fit in, so if you want to stop by and say hi, please do.

I'll then be heading off to [NDC in Oslo](http://www.ndc2010.no/index.aspx) for more of the same, along with Neal Gafter. If you want to find out what happens when you get me, Neal, Mads, Jon Skeet and a bunch more interesting people in a room together all talking about the past, present and future of C\#, this is your chance.

I'm super excited -- I have not gone to speak at an industry conference outside of Seattle since the VSTO band (The Red Pills) played at VSLive Los Angeles in 2004. And I haven't given a talk in Europe since VBITS Stockholm in... 1999? A long time ago.
