Good heavens, I just realized I completely forgot to post [a link to this interview](http://www.code-magazine.com/codecast/index.aspx?messageid=6c436b38-2e9b-4f1a-9e6a-71a97c782d5f). I'm a year late, but better late than never.

A year ago Ken stopped by my office and we had a very freewheeling, entertaining and rather random conversation about many diverse aspects of programming language design. If you're interested and you have 45 minutes to spare, check it out. Audio only, for a change.

(Eric is at TechEd; this posting is pre-recorded. As is the interview.)
