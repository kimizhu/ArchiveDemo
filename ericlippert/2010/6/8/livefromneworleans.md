Just a quick note that Mads, Luke and I are going to be on Channel 9 Live from TechEdÂ  this afternoon talking about C\#, F\# and whatever else strikes our fancy. It's live video; anything can happen. Tune in to [www.msteched.com](http://www.msteched.com); we're scheduled to be on at 3:30 PM Central Daylight Time. (There has been some confusion on this point; I note that Central Daylight Time is a time zone that is not Eastern, Mountain or Pacific time.)

Check it out; there is already a tonne of great video there.

UPDATE: The video is archived here:

Fast forward to 4 hours 25 minutes in.
