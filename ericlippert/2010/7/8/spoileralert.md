The remaining video of the talk with Neal Gafter and me at NDC is up on the streaming content server now, [here](http://streaming.ndc2010.no/tcs/?id=E915B78B-D9B7-4CE9-96DA-2B794391AD2F). However, spoiler alert: if you don't want to know the solutions to the eight puzzles we present, don't watch the video.

Of course, long time readers of this blog have probably seen about half of them already; we mined the blog for topics.

This was a fun session; we actually got audience participation from Scandinavian developers, which according to the Scandinavian trainers I talked to beforehand is not always the easiest thing to do.
