I am pleased to announce that [MSDN Magazine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/default.aspx) is doing a special issue this month on the new "async-await" feature that we are working on for the next versions of C\# and Visual Basic. If this subject interests you, see [my introductory article for beginners](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh456401.aspx), Mads Torgersen's article on[how it works behind the scenes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh456403.aspx) and Stephen Toub's [expert-level article on async performance](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh456402.aspx). And of course, for a much longer introduction to the topic, see [my long series from earlier this year](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/tags/async/). If you want to try it out yourself, download the CTP build from [the async CTP main page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/async.aspx).

Please do keep the great feedback coming\! If you have comments, questions or constructive feedback on any aspect of the new feature, [please post it to the async forum](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/async/threads). Thanks\!
