I've never owned an Apple product; I haven't written Mac software professionally since working on the Mac version of Visual Basic briefly in 1994. Nevertheless, **Steve Jobs inspired me every day**. Wanting to make "insanely great" technology is one thing. Having someone prove, over and over again, that **the insanely great is actually within our grasp** is another thing entirely. Thank you, Steve.
