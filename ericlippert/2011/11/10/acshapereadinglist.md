Just a couple of quick links today.

First: One of the questions I get most frequently is "*can you recommend some good books about learning to program better in C\#?*" The question is usually asked by a developer; the other day I was surprised to get that question from one of the editors of InformIT. She was kind enough to post the list on the InformIT web site, so [check it out](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1769249).

Second: Bill Wagner posts his own follow-up article on [my recent MSDN magazine article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh456401.aspx) about async/await. [Check it out](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh533273.aspx).
