We interrupt our series on compound assignment operators with a quick note to say check out my interview on .NET Rocks\!

<http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=649>

We have a long, rambling conversation about languages, tools, AI, you name it. 

Thanks to Carl and Richard for the interview; I enjoyed it immensely.

(Incidentally, the reason at the beginning I said "*And this is a very special pi day because... oh wait, no it isn't*" is because mere *moments* before the interview a friend had sent me a calendar meeting request saying "this is a very special pi day, 3/14/15".  Of course the calendar item was **post-dated four years into the future**. Apparently it was very important to her that I get this into my calendar well in advance. And so of course this completely bogus information was fresh in my brain, and popped out of my mouth before I thought about it. Clearly I should engage brain before mouth.)
