Good heavens I can't believe it's been [two years since I wished Channel 9 a happy fifth birthday](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/Eric-Lippert-Happy-Birthday-C9).

Obviously it's been [a busy month for me doing interviews](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2011/03/30/dot-net-rocks.aspx). If you're not sick of hearing me rattling on about compilers, Roslyn, and so on, [check out my latest C9 interview with Charles and Erik Meijer](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Checking-In-with-Erik-Meijer/Checking-In-Eric-Lippert-On-Compiler-Evolution-Designing-C-and-Blogging).
