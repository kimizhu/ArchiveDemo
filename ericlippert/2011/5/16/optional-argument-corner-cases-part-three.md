(This is part three of a series on the corner cases of optional arguments in C\# 4; part two is [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2011/05/12/optional-argument-corner-cases-part-two.aspx). Part four is [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2011/05/19/optional-argument-corner-cases-part-four.aspx).)

A lot of people seem to think that this:

<span class="code"> </span>

void M(string x, bool y = false) { ... whatever ... }

is actually a syntactic sugar for the way you used to have to write this in C\#, which is:

<span class="code"> </span>

void M(string x) { M(x, false); }  
void M(string x, bool y) { ... whatever ... }

But it is not. The syntactic sugar here is not on the declaration side, but rather on the call side. There is only one method; when you make a call that omits optional arguments, the compiler simply inserts the arguments at the call site. That is:

<span class="code"> </span>

M("hello");

is rewritten as

<span class="code"> </span>

M("hello", false);

It would actually be pretty weird if we did it on the declaration side, because what would you do about this?

<span class="code"> </span>

void N(bool a1 = false, bool a2 = false) { ... whatever ... }

Clearly we can't generate

<span class="code"> </span>

void N() { N(false, false); }  
void N(bool a1) { N(a1, false); }  
void N(bool a2) { N(false, a2); }  
void N(bool a1, bool a2) { ... whatever ... }

because now we have two methods with the same signature. But why would we need to generate the "a2" method in the first place? Because we added **named arguments** as well as optional arguments. Someone could call:

<span class="code"> </span>

N(a2: true);

Clearly we have to rewrite the caller side, not the called side.

An argument with a default value does not change the signature at all, so anything that relies upon signature matching still needs to have an exact match. That is, even though you can say:

<span class="code"> </span>

M("hello");

and you can say

<span class="code"> </span>

Action\<string\> action = (string s)=\>{M(s);};

You cannot say

<span class="code"> </span>

Action\<string\> action = M;

Because M does not have a signature match with that delegate type; the delegate is expecting a method that takes a string, but you're giving it a method that takes a string and a bool. Where is the code generated that fills in the bool? There is no call site here, and the default value has to be filled in at the call site.

Similarly, you can't do something like this:

<span class="code"> </span>

class B  
{  
  public virtual void M(string x, bool y = false) {}  
}  
class D : B  
{  
  public override void M(string x) {}  
}

Or this:

<span class="code"> </span>

class D : B  
{  
  public override void M(string x, bool y = false, int z = 123) {}  
}

The signatures have to match to do an override, and default values for missing arguments are not part of the signature.

**Next time:** more consequences of call-site rewriting.
