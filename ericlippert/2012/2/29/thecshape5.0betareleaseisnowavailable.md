I am super excited to announce that the beta release of Visual Studio version 11 (which includes the .NET CLR version 4.5, Visual Basic version 11 and C\# version 5) is available for download right now. As you know if you've been following our CTP releases, in C\# and VB we've greatly improved the ease of programming in an asynchronous "continuation-passing" style such that the compilers do the hard work of rearranging the code into a form amenable to asynchrony, so that you don't have to. VB also now has iterator blocks, and has surpassed C\# in that **VB iterator blocks can even be inside lambdas**. Pretty neat.

And that's just the big stuff for C\# and VB; there is an enormous amount of new stuff here in the languages, the tools and the runtime. I can't wait to see what developers do with all of these amazing features. Please, [download the beta](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us/downloads) and [give us feedback](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/vsvnext) on what you like and what you don't like.
