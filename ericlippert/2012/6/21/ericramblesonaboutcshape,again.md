Rachel Roumeliotis, who amongst other things edits C\# books for O'Reilly, recently did an interview with me where I ramble on about async/await, Roslyn, performance analysis as an engineering discipline, and some broad-strokes ideas for future language research areas. If you have sixteen minutes to burn, check it out\! The O'Reilly Radar blog post is [here](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/06/c-sharp-5-eric-lippert.html), and the video has also been posted to YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_sMePYs8s).

A couple things to mention here; first, I say in the video that we've shipped one preview release of Roslyn; in fact we have shipped two. The video was recorded before we had announced the new release. And second, I want to re-emphasize that the end bit where you get more of Eric's musings about ideas for future language research areas are for your entertainment. We have not announced any product beyond Roslyn, and we are certainly making no promises whatsoever about the feature sets of unannounced, entirely hypothetical products. Enjoy\!
