Just a quick link today:

The super nice people over at InformIT (\*) are running a series of short articles with the theme "the best advice I ever got", which I think should prove to be an interesting series. They were kind enough to ask me to give [an example of some good advice I got that helped my programming career](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1919436), though as you'll see it is not *actually* about programming at all.

(\*) You may recall that they also recently asked me for my advice [on good books for C\# programmers](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2011/11/10/a-c-reading-list.aspx). In the interests of full disclosure, I note that in my spare time I write and edit C\# programming books for Addison-Wesley, which is owned by the same company that owns InformIT.
