No tech today, but this is too funny to not pass along, so consider this your fun for Friday.  
  
What would happen if [Anders Hejlsberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg) and [Barbara Liskov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov) were forced to [share an apartment](https://twitter.com/HejlsOrHighH2O) in an "odd couple" sitcom? (\*)

Apparently I'm the "Kramer" of this sitcom. I hope I'm played by [Ryan Gosling](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2012/01/02/he-s-so-dreamy.aspx). Additional suggestions on casting the principal roles can be left in the comments.

(\*) A single-threaded apartment, I'd assume.
