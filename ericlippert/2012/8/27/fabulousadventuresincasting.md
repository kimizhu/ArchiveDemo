# Fabulous Adventures In Casting

I've [written a lot about casting over the years in this blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/tags/cast+operator/), but always in the context of the "cast operator": the operator that instructs the compiler to make an explicit conversion from a value of one type to a value of another type. I have recently taken up a new hobby that is casting of an entirely different sort: the casting of molten metal into a mold made of sand to form a desired shape.

I have no experience whatsoever with any kind of metalworking, so I'm learning as I go here and making mistakes along the way. I'm going to document the results of these experiments on my new blog, [Fabulous Adventures In Casting](http://faicasting.tumblr.com/). If this subject interests you, check it out\!

We now return to our regularly scheduled discussion of the "is" operator in C\#.
